Worldsmith
==========

Open source Dota 2 Mod Editor inspired by Warcraft 3's World Edit.  

You can get in contact with the developers using IRC, #dota2mods on irc.gamesurge.net.  

## Current Status

Worldsmith is still in the very early stages.  I hope to have an Alpha out soon, but software development takes time.

## Credits

Without a few people, this project would be much much harder.  In no particular order:

* penguinwizzard for figuring out how to write maps.
* tet, Sir_Kane, and hex6 for finding the strings for most of the flags and enums.
* hex6 for doing the legwork for setting up translations.
* Quintinity for cleaning up the quality and doing incredibly helpful quality work.  
* OrangeSodaSmurf for providing a coupon for a free domain name.

### Translation credits

* Swedish - hex6
